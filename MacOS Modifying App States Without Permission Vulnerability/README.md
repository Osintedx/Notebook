# macOS - Modifying App States Without Permission Vulnerability

**Reported on:** January 11, 2025, 10:17 AM

**OE Number:** OE1100444157343

**OE ORIGINAL NUMBER:** OE1996646905016

**Status:** Resolved & Addressed

## What is required to reproduce the issue?

An unsandboxed macOS application

## Summary

Swift has the capability to modify the states of both running and closed applications by accessing the App States folder located at `~/Library/Saved Application State`. This allows for unintended modifications to application windows, potentially leading to security and privacy concerns.rns.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Obtain the bundle identifier of the target application.
2. Locate the corresponding folder within `~/Library/Saved Application State`.
3. Write arbitrary data to files within this folder. This written data can lead to modifications of the application's window state upon its next launch.

## Expected results

Write access to the application's state directory should be denied for unauthorized processes.

## Actual results

Write access is granted without any notification or prompt to the user, allowing for silent modification of application states.

## Impact

This vulnerability could potentially be exploited to:
- Manipulate application window positions and states
- Cause unexpected behavior in applications
- Create a misleading user experience
- Potentially lead to phishing attempts through window manipulation
